On November 6, 2017 I received a life changing email - I was offered a seat to the Google Developer Scholarship Challenge at Udacity. Little did I know that I had it in me to become a developer. As I write those lines in November 2019, I still can't believe how far I've gone. From total newbie, with no knowledge of computer science, to now confident android developer, data science and AI practitioner. I am so very grateful to Udacity and the generous sponsorship of Google.

Please find the android developement projects that I submitted to the [Android Basics Nanodegree by Google](https://confirm.udacity.com/XAF5RDPS) in the repositories linked below. So far I left most of them as they were when I submitted them.
